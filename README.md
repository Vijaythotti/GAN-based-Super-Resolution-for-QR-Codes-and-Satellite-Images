# GAN-based Super-Resolution for QR Codes and Satellite Images

## 📈 Project Description
This project implements a GAN model using TensorFlow to enhance the resolution of:
- QR Code images
- Satellite images

The model:
✅ Generates high-resolution outputs  
✅ Merges datasets  
✅ Auto-downloads enhanced images  
✅ (Optional) Supports Telegram/Email automation (WIP)

---

## 🗂️ Dataset
- Images auto-combined into `satellite_dataset.png`
- Format: 256x256 patches

---

## 🚀 Features
- TensorFlow GAN Architecture
- Generator & Discriminator with loss functions
- Auto-download output to your system
- Training progress images every 50 epochs
- Easy dataset creation with sample images

---

## 📥 Installation
```bash
pip install tensorflow pillow matplotlib numpy
